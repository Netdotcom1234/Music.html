    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <h2>"Faded"
(feat. Iselin Solheim)</h2>

<p>
You were the shadow to my light<br><br>
Did you feel us?<br><br>
Another star<br><br>
You fade
away<br><br>
Afraid our aim is out of sight<br><br>
Wanna see us<br><br>
Alight<br><br>

Where are you now?<br><br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Was it all in my fantasy?<br><br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Were you only imaginary?<br><br>

Where are you now?<br><br>
Atlantis<br><br>
Under the sea<br><br>
Under the sea<br><br>
Where are you now?<br><br>
Another dream<br><br>
The monster's running wild inside of me<br><br>
I'm faded<br><br>
I'm faded<br><br>
So lost, I'm faded<br><br>
I'm faded<br><br>
So lost, I'm faded<br><br>
</p>
